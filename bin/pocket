=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program provides several subcommands to allow you to interact with your
Pocket list from the command line. It will automatically authenticate as
needed, prompting you for your consumer key, and will store the returned
credentials in C<~/.pocket>.

=head1 COMMANDS

=head2 authenticate

Authenticates you with the Pocket API and does nothing else. Not usually
necessary, since all of the following commands will automatically authenticate
as necessary.

=head2 list

Prints the URLs in your list. By default, prints unread URLs, but also takes options to adjust the list that is returned:

=item --unread

Return only unread links. This is the default, but can be provided for
explicitness.

=item --archive

Return only archived links.

=item --all

Return both unread and archived links.

=item --tag=<tag>

Return links with the given tag. This option can be passed multiple times, and
may be combined with the above options.

Takes the same options as C<list>, but instead of printing the URLs of the
articles, prints the number of words in all of those articles combined.
